-----------------------------------------
done
v- turn off link underline in frmfolder, frmlstctrl and frmlstdsp
v- limit number of folders in addfolder
v- reload frmfolder after mailxfer (pull mails)
v- not show add/rename folder in float menu for builtin folders (in/out/trash)
v- check pop mail on mail tool bar 
v- after xfer, the in box is owned by root - typo in mailxfer.cpp
v- remove folder content when folder is deleted

fix:
- make sure transfer to a valid mail box
- change status graphic in frmlist when open message
- mail count is off in MailList

nice:
- close folder float menu when blur
- move to a different directory... coexist with old version.
- disable right mouse click
- preview first unread mail automatically
- make index for mailbox
- logout in popup window should logout at opener.top
- auto reload after pref change
- update the dest read/unread count during xfer
- say folder not exist rather than no mail when run wwwmail?badfolder
- save message window size
