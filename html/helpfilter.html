            For those of you that are familiar with this process, the filters 
            may be constructed using the following &quot;expressions&quot;:<br>
            <br>
            ^ Start of a line. <br>
            $ End of a line. <br>
            . Any character except a new line. <br>
            a* Any sequence of zero or more a's. <br>
            a+ Any sequence of one or more a's. <br>
            a? Either zero or one a. <br>
            [^a-d-] any character which is not either an a,b,c,d, or a dash. <br>
            de|abc Either the sequence `de' or `abc'. <br>
            (abc)* Zero or more times the sequence `abc'. <br>
            \. Matches a single dot; use \ to quote a metacharacter to get rid 
            of its special meaning. <br>
            <br>
            A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings. 
            Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic 
            expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller 
            expressions. <br>
            <br>
            The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that 
            match a single character. Most characters, including all letters and 
            digits, are regular expressions that match themselves. Any 
            metacharacter with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it 
            with a backslash.<br>
            <br>
            A list of characters enclosed by [ and ] matches any single 
            character in that list; if the first character of the list is the 
            caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list. For example, 
            the regular expression [0123456789] matches any single digit. A 
            range of ASCII characters may be specified by giving the first and 
            last characters, separated by a hyphen.<br>
            <br>
            Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined. Their 
            names are self explanatory, and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:cntrl:], 
            [:digit:], [:graph:], [:lower:], [:print:], [:punct:], [:space:], 
            [:upper:], and [:xdigit:]. For example, [[:alnum:]] means 
            [0-9A-Za-z], except the latter form is dependent upon the ASCII 
            character encoding, whereas the former is portable. (Note that the 
            brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and 
            must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket 
            list.) <br>
            <br>
            Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists. To 
            include a literal ] place it first in the list. Similarly, to 
            include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first. Finally, to include 
            a literal - place it last. <br>
            <br>
            The period . matches any single character. The symbol \w is a 
            synonym for [[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^[:alnum]]<br>
            <br>
            The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are metacharacters that 
            respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a 
            line. The symbols \&lt; and \&gt; respectively match the empty string at 
            the beginning and end of a word. The symbol \b matches the empty 
            string at the edge of a word, and \B matches the empty string 
            provided it's not at the edge of a word.<br>
            <br>
            A regular expression matching a single character may be followed by 
            one of several repetition operators:<br>
            <br>
            ? The preceding item is optional and matched at most once. <br>
            * The preceding item will be matched zero or more times. <br>
            + The preceding item will be matched one or more times. <br>
            {n} The preceding item is matched exactly n times. <br>
            {n,} The preceding item is matched n or more times. <br>
            {,m} The preceding item is optional and is matched at most m times.
            <br>
            {n,m} The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more 
            than m times. </font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#396BB5">Two regular 
            expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression 
            matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that 
            respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.<br>
            <br>
            Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the 
            resulting regular expression matches any string matching either 
            subexpression.<br>
            <br>
            Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes 
            precedence over alternation. A whole subexpression may be enclosed
